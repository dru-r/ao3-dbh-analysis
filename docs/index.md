## More details:
#### What is this?
A small collection of images/visualisations of analyses I've done on the AO3 D:BH fandom. The preprocessing and nitty-gritty details are on my main blog - this site is just for other D:BH fans (or anyone interested, really) to have an easier time exploring the results.<br>

#### What data is being used for the analyses?
13,933 English language stories published from May 2018 to mid-October 2019 under the Detroit: Become Human fandom tag from AO3. No cross-over fics, fic word-count of at least 10 words.<br>

#### Why are you doing this?
Spare time and a love for fandom.
