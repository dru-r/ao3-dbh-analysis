## about me
This is a little side-project I'm maintaining while I complete my research masters and wait to start a full-time job. <br>
<br>
Formal stuffy background: I come from a psychology background and my research is in the field of computational social science. I'm interested in studying online communities; my formal work so far has dealt mainly with social media data. Fandom however has always been the closest to me, so here we are.
<br>
<br>
Methods-wise, I'm keen on text analysis, network representations/analysis and statistical analysis in general. And of course, useful interactive visualisations - something I'm frankly still bad at, but believe has a lot of value in aiding interpretation.
<br>
<br>
There is definitely still a lot for me to learn and improve on! I am happy to take any feedback, thoughts and/or questions; you can contact me [here](https://program-800.tumblr.com/ask).
