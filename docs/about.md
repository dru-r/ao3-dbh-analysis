## about me
This is a little side-project I'm maintaining in my spare time. <br>
<br>
Formal stuffy background: I come from a psychology background and I enjoy learning and applying computational methods to help answer social science problems. I'm interested in studying online communities; fandom being the closest to me made it a natural choice for a personal project.
<br>
<br>
Methods-wise, I'm keen on text analysis, network representations/analysis, and statistical analysis in general. And of course, useful interactive visualisations - something I'm frankly still bad at, but believe has a lot of value in aiding interpretation.
<br>
<br>
There is definitely still a lot for me to learn and improve on! I am happy to take any feedback, thoughts and/or questions; you can contact me [here](https://program-800.tumblr.com/ask).
