# Topics in AO3 Detroit: Become Human fics
What are some topics that appear in D:BH fics?<br>
(Yes, there is smut. There is always smut.)<br>

This was a little exercise I did to try preprocessing for topic modelling (specifically, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, or LDA) on a form of text (long-form fiction) that I typically don't work with in my research. The results aren't too exciting but they're largely interpretable (which is good), so I'm sharing them here. <b>Full blog post detailing preprocessing [here]</b>.

### Interactive visualisation is [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dru-r/ao3-dbh-analysis/blob/master/docs/vanilla%20lda_detroit%20ao3.ipynb)
LDA doesn't generate topic labels for the user, so here are some topic labels I subjectively came up with based on the output [below](###suggested-topic-labels)

## Details about the visualisation
I built the LDA model with Gensim and the visualisation was created using pyLDAvis.<br>

Some things to note, presented in a rather hand-wavey way:
- <b>Circle size</b>: prevalance of topic in corpus. You'll notice that topics 1 and 2 are relatively larger than the rest and are also kind of more general. This is an artefact of a choice by me to follow [this research paper](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/papers/NIPS2009_0929.pdf). As the authors observed it has the nice effect of putting corpus (in this case, DBH)-specific common words into just a couple of frequent topics (i.e., topics 1 and 2). 
- <b>Distances between circles</b>: topics close in semantic meaning should appear closer together. This is achieved via dimensionality reduction. I wouldn't read too much into the actual distances, but the relative distances may be interesting (e.g. topics 24 and 31 - on the bedroom and bathroom - are relatively close).
- <b>List of terms as you click through each topic</b>: useful words for trying to make sense on the topic.
- <b>The blue bars next to each term</b>: overall frequency of the term in the corpus (e.g. 'humans' has a blue bar that almost hits 50k).
- <b>The sliding bar on the top (relevance metric, with adjustable lambda Î»)</b>: The [original research paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W14-3110.pdf) suggests setting it at 0.6 for optimal human interpretation. But in any case, you definitely can play around with it. Setting it at 1 gives you the default output from LDA, and setting it at 0 sets it to really topic-specific words (notice the change in proportion between the red:blue bars). 
- <b>Hovering over a term</b>: To see in what other topics the term appears in (circle size proportional to term-specific frequencies in corpus). A term might appear in different topics because words typically have more than one meaning (e.g. duck - a bird, or to lower one's body).
