# User interest in ships in the AO3 D:BH fandom
This is somewhat of a follow-up to my initial post on [kudo descriptives](dbh-kudosbasic.md).<br>
<br>
<b>This plot answers two simple questions: <br>
(1) How many registered AO3 users have indicated interest in a particular D:BH ship, and <br>
(2) How many interested users do two particular D:BH ships share? <br>
<br>
You can find the plot [here](/visuals/13b_kudos_network/ao3_dbh_kudos_filter.html).</b> The hover information (i.e., the raw counts shown on nodes/edges) have been separately compiled into two tables: [nodes](/visuals/13b_kudos_network/node_table.html) and [edges](/visuals/13b_kudos_network/edge_table.html). Preprocessing and creation of the plot [in this Tumblr post](insert link later). <br>
<br>
Main points to note are: <br>
(1) User interest is defined as (a) being the author of a fic with the particular ship(s), and/or (b) leaving a kudos on a fic with the particular ship(s), <br>
(2) Only registered accounts were accounted for, since there is no way for me to disambiguate guest kudos. <br>
<br>
The plot is very simple to read: <br>
(1) Larger-sized nodes = relatively more registered users have indicated interest in the particular ship<br>
(2) Thicker edges = relatively more registered users have indicated interest in both the specified ships<br>
<br>
I may refine/add on to this brief exploration in future, will keep this space updated.
