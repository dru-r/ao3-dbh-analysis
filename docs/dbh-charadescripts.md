# Understanding fanon representations from story tags
It's no secret that fanon and canon representations of characters can diverge quite a bit - if you've read any amount of fic, that much is clear. This divergence fascinates me <i>a ton</i> and was one of the driving factors for me to pick up programming and text analysis. Why is there this divergence? Why are certain qualities ascribed more to some characters than others? 
<br><br>
I find this especially interesting in the realm of slash. Even in the absence of explicit homosexual relationships in canon material to guide assignment, we can often find certain characters appearing more as bottoms (or tops) than others in fanon. Are there characteristics - personality-wise, appearance-wise - in the character's canon form that predisposes them to a particular role in fanon?
<br><br>
I don't think these questions can be fully answered by quantitative methods. And we're getting ahead of ourselves anyway. To answer these questions, we need to start from the very beginning - <i><b>what is the fanon character like, anyway</b></i>? And that's something I think quantitative methods can help with, given the huge amount of text we need to summarise and sift through. <br>
<br>
In this analysis, I focus <b>only on author-provided tags</b>. Obviously, that means we only get a part of the picture, since qualities are likely described and performed much more within the text of the story itself. Those may be more difficult to retrieve though, so I'm starting small. Methodology covered in [a blog post] (link later).

<b>This analysis is still in-progress. I will update with other characters as I complete them.</b> Wordclouds generated using the WordCloud library of Python. Character masks are screencaps I got off Google and edited myself.

<b>Top 3 words in the wordcloud are: <i>bottom, adorable, trans</i>.</b> <br>
This is interesting given that Connor in canon is the most advanced android model out on the field and is built specifically to hunt other (deviant) androids. In most of his routes, you will kill at least one person/android. This includes the 'good' Connor route, if you want to keep him alive.
<br><br>
For clarity I separated 'deviant', 'machine', and 'human' descriptions from the wordcloud. The breakdown is here: <br>

We see a clear preference for deviant Connor.
