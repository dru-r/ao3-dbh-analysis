# Understanding fanon representations of characters from story tags
It's no secret that fanon and canon representations of characters can diverge quite a bit - if you've read any amount of fic, that much is clear. This divergence fascinates me <i>a ton</i> and was one of the driving factors for me to pick up programming and text analysis. Why is there this divergence? Why are certain qualities ascribed more to some characters than others? 
<br><br>
I find this especially interesting in the realm of slash. Even in the absence of explicit homosexual relationships in canon material to guide assignment, we can often find certain characters appearing more as bottoms (or tops) than others in fanon. Are there characteristics - personality-wise, appearance-wise - in the character's canon form that predisposes them to a particular role in fanon?
<br><br>
I don't think these questions can be fully answered by quantitative methods. And we're getting ahead of ourselves anyway. To answer these questions, we need to start from the very beginning - <i><b>what is the fanon character like, anyway</b></i>? And that's something I think quantitative methods can help with, given the huge amount of text we need to summarise and sift through. <br>
<br>
In this analysis, I focus <b>only on author-provided tags</b>. Obviously, that means we only get a part of the picture, since qualities are likely described and performed much more within the text of the story itself. Those may be more difficult to retrieve though, so I'm starting small. Methodology covered in [a blog post](https://program-800.tumblr.com/post/190178483501/exploring-dbh-fics-part-8).

<b>This analysis is still in-progress. I will update with other characters as I complete them.</b> Wordclouds generated using the WordCloud library of Python. Character masks are screencaps I got off Google and edited myself.

## Characters
1) [Connor](#connor-in-fanon)<br>
2) [RK900](#rk900-in-fanon)<br>
<br>
<b>Extra</b>: [Personal reflections as a fic writer](#reflections)<br>

## Connor in fanon

<b>Top 3 words in the wordcloud are: <i>bottom, adorable, trans</i>.</b> <br>
This is interesting given that Connor in canon is the most advanced android model out on the field and is built specifically to hunt other (deviant) androids. In most of his routes, you will kill at least one person/android. This includes the 'good' Connor route, if you want to keep him alive. More ramblings about this in [reflections](#reflections).
<br><br>
For clarity I separated 'deviant', 'machine', and 'human' descriptions from the wordcloud. The breakdown is here: <br>

We see a clear preference for deviant Connor.

## RK900 in fanon

<b>Top 3 words in the wordcloud are: <i>top, protective, soft</i>.</b> <br>
RK900 is another interesting case. We don't actually have much of a "canon" RK900, since we only see him on the machine Connor route for a couple of seconds and he doesn't say anything (beyond staring at Connor as he leaves). Yet, the wordcloud suggests a rather coherent picture that the fandom has developed for RK900. To me, it seems a fair bit more dominant/stronger than Connor's fanon depiction. Why? I can only guess it's because he's supposed to be an 'upgrade' to Connor, but physically, his appearance is exactly the same - save for the fact that he has blue eyes instead of brown.

Again, for clarity I separated 'deviant', 'machine', and 'human' descriptions from the wordcloud. The breakdown is here: <br>

We see a clear preference for deviancy in RK900 too.

## Reflections
<b> Or, personal expositions as a fic writer, that nobody asked for</b><br><br>
<b>ON CONNOR</b>: To me, I think the wordcloud really shows the success of Connor's design. It's not explicitly discussed in the game (though Connor does explain to Hank that he was designed in this manner to be able to work well with humans), but I feel that Connor's soft/gentle design had a lot of impact overall on how everything played out. If Connor didn't look the way he does:<br><br>
1) Humans would not let their guard down around him. Of course, that means less people being rude to him, but it also would make it harder for him to get around/snoop.<br><br>
2) Connor may get less sympathy and/or be played as a killing machine more than a conflicted deviant. <br><br>
3) Hank, Hank, Hank. His relationship with Hank. Even though Hank constantly says the opposite, many of his actions show that Connor's design does have an impact on him. There's treating Connor like a human, of course (and getting annoyed when Connor does something in-human that breaks the illusion), telling Connor to get behind him before they open a fugitive's apartment (logically, this makes little sense - Connor is technically replaceable, he should go in first), and his huge hang-up at the bridge about what/who Connor actually is. <br><br>
Connor being aware of the implications of his design suggests to me that he isn't really that clueless or oblivious. Yes, he does say some offbeat things early in the game but he seems to learn pretty quickly. That lopsided grin of his? I think he learned it from Hank, in the scene after he breaks into Hank's house and sobers him up. <i>He mirrors the grin that Hank has on his face, back to Hank.</i> When asking Hank for extra time on the crime scene, he chooses to shoot Hank puppy eyes (and this leads to Hank obliging).<br><br>
TL;DR yes, Connor's cute. He's best boi to me too. But my interpretation of him is that he's a lot smarter than he wants to let on; he probably knows to some degree that his design can be used for manipulation - so that's why I found the results of the worldcloud really interesting (though I could already infer the general fanon depiction of Connor from copious fic reading).
