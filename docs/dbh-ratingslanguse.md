# Differences in word use between AO3 D:BH fics of different ratings
Do mature-rated fics use different language from explicit-rated fics? What words are generally used more in teen-rated fics versus mature-rated fics? <br>
<br>
We can already guess how explicit fics may differ from the rest (sMuT) so my interest in running this analysis was really to see:
1) What differentiates the general audience/teen/mature fics from each other, and 
2) What differentiates mature/explicit fics (since mature-rated fics may also make references to sex/violence). <br>
<br>
<b>Note: I dropped Not Rated fics for this analysis, leaving 12647 fics for analysis. Full blog post on preprocessing and other details here. (link details later).</b> <br>
<br>
To recap AO3's rating system, taken from [here](https://archiveofourown.org/faq/tutorial-posting-a-work-on-ao3?language_id=en#pwtrating):<br>
- General Audiences: The content is unlikely to be disturbing to anyone, and is suitable for all ages. <br>
- Teen And Up Audiences: The content may be inappropriate for audiences under 13. <br>
- Mature: The content contains adult themes (sex, violence, etc) that aren't as graphic as explicit-rated content.<br>
- Explicit: The content contains explicit adult themes, such as porn, graphic violence, etc.<br>
