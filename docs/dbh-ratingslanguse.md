# Differences in word use between AO3 D:BH fics of different ratings
Do mature-rated fics use different language from explicit-rated fics? What words are generally used more in teen-rated fics versus mature-rated fics? <br>
<br>
We can already guess how explicit fics may differ from the rest (sMuT) so my interest in running this analysis was really to see:
1) What differentiates the general audience/teen/mature fics from each other, and 
2) What differentiates mature/explicit fics (since mature-rated fics may also make references to sex/violence). <br>
