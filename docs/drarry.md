# Drarry on AO3

Sometime in March 2021, AO3 very generously released a [data dump](https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/18804) of all the fics on its site. With this data release, I'm finally able to revisit the very first ship that got me into fandom so many years ago - Harry Potter/Draco Malfoy (Drarry). <br><br>
Drarry - I think - really was a pretty pivotal ship in shaping a fair amount of fandom as we know it today. And there's something so thrillingly expansive and beautiful about the ship itself. I think Drarry is bolstered by a certain amount of canon believability that writers and readers can ascribe to it. <br><br>
I've gone through many ships, but none have ever drawn me back as much as Drarry has been able to. So - I'm really happy to be able to work with this data to have a look at this very long, storied, yet still-growing ship.
